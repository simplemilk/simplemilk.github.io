                <h1>Project 3: Refined Analysis of the Heat Levels in the Great Barrier Reefs (Unfinished)</h1>
                <h2 id="stats">Introduction</h2>
                <p>
                    84.4% of the world's coral reef has been impacted by bleaching.<sup>1</sup>
                    Coral bleaching is a coral's response to environmental stress which results in expelling tiny algaes called <i>zooxanthellae</i> 
                    causing the coral turning white.<sup>2</sup></spu>
                    The algae is important and essential for corals as they help produce sugars for the corals to consume through photosynthesis and more than
                    90% of the corals food requirements come from these algae.<sup>2</sup>
                    When the corals turn white, they become vulnerable and potentially could die depending on how high the water temperature stays.
                    In the cases where the coral is able to recover, they show signs of growing slower, reduced reproduction, and suspectible of diseases.
                </p>

                <p>Corals are important assets in the marine wildwife as they are habitats for marine animals use to avoid predators. 
                    Some marine animals also feed on coral in order to sustain their diet such as sea turtles and protect coastlines from flooding during storms.
                    They are also one of the biggest factors in the ocean's ability to absorb carbon dioxide emissions and excess heat in the atmosphere.<sup>3</sup>
                    Thus, it is important to notice what is going on with the coral ecosystem to see what kind of changes have occured
                    and monitor any potential changes in the ocean waters while also monitoring the changes in coral bleaching.
                </p>
                
                <p>For this study, I conducted an observation of the data that was compiled by the National Environmental Satellite, Data, and Information Service (NOAA) 
                    looking specifically at the Great Barrier Reef from the years 2020-2025 with data of 7 day changes in temperature. 
                    This specific area was chosen due to its popularity, but also having data on the entire globe can go up to several hundreds of gigabytes.
                    In this study, I wish to be able to find the answer to three questions based on this data:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        What time period is found to have the highest amount of heat signature levels in the last five years?
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Are we able to find significant differences in heat signature in the northern compared to the south Great Barrier Reef?
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Can we identify which sections of the pacific ocean has coral bleaching?
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <h3 id="time-period">
                   What time period had the highest heat signature? 
                </h3>
                <p>
                    While looking at the data, there was a couple of things that stood out while analyzing the line graph for the temperature changes in the Great Barrier Reef.
                    While observing the temperature changes, it can be noted that the temperature of the water changes drastically based on season as the summer time for the southern hemisphere is from december - february.
                    So looking at the graph there is indicaitons of increase temperatures at the start of the year then drastically decreases after it hits the fall season.
                    However, the question would be is it consistently true in all regions of the map? So to test this we can check if there is a difference in the north and south coral reefs.
                </p>
                
                <div class="chart-container">

                </div>

                <h3 id="north-south">
                    Is there significant differences in the north and south temperatures?
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Looking at the graph there seems to be a difference in regard to the overall temperature between the two regions of the Great Barrier Reef.
                    When examining, it seems that the overall temperature in the northern regions seems to be over the general acceptable temperature resulting in higher chances of irreversible coral bleaching.
                    When looking at the temperature for that of the southern region, looking at the drastic decrease in temperature, it could be potentially that the temperature decrease is mostly resulted from regions outside the north.
                    So it can be stated that the north is potentially holding a significant amount of higher temperatures but to see a clearer view of this we can do a heat map.

                <h3 id="bleaching">
                    Can we identify where bleaching occurs?
                </h3>
                <p>
                    To an extent. Looking at how the heat map below, you can see where there are regions where there isn't much of an impact of coral bleaching on average but then when
                    checking areas in the northern region you can see there are very deep colors of red on the edges.
                    This could explain the significant high temperatures in the map especially in the top right portion.
                    Whereas when checking the bottom portion we can see that there is the lighest portion, this could be potentially due it it being closer to the australian shore line.
                    When the water hits the shoreline it has various factors that help with reducing the temperatures such as upwelling which is the process that helps with moving warm water away from the shore.<sup>5</sup>
                    The reason in contrast why the shoreline of papa new guinea (the northern white blot) is warmer is due to it being closer to the equator as well which is generally the reason for warmer temperatures in that region.

                <h3 id="conclusion"> Conclusion </h3>
                <p>
                    In conclusion, the data that can be interpreted is that when it comes to chances of irreversible coral bleaching is generally in the northern area in comparison to the southern reefs.
                    THis could be potentially due to the cooling mechanisms from the sea shore helps reduce the amount of heat in the lower portion of the great barrier reef compared to the north.
                    While the northern shoreline is due to it being closer to the equator.
                    Thus it can be stated that it is potentially problematic for the coral reefs in this region to have such high temperatures and some changes are required to prevent further damages to the coral ecossystem.
