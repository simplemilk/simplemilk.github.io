          <h2>Types of Payment</h2>
            <h3>Fixed Costs (Always Paid)</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>Premium:</strong> The monthly or yearly fee you pay to keep your policy active. It's like a subscription.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Administrative Fees:</strong> Small charges for paperwork or late payments (may vary by provider).
                </li>
              </ul>

            <h3>Out-of-Pocket Costs (Paid When You Use the Insurance)</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Deductible:</strong> The amount you pay before your insurance starts covering claims.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Copayment (Copay):</strong> A set fee you pay for specific services like a doctor's visit.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Coinsurance:</strong> A percentage of costs you pay after meeting your deductible (e.g., 20%).
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Out-of-Pocket Maximum:</strong> The most you will have to pay in a year; insurance covers 100% after that.
