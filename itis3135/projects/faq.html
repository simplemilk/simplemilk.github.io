          <h3>Where are you from?</h3>
          <p>I am from <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daegu>Daegu, South Korea</a>. I have moved to the US around 1991 where I moved in with my sister and brother at their home.</p>

        <section id="inspiration">
          <h3>What made you want to become an Insurance Agent?</h3>
          <p>Prior to being in the US, I used to work as an architect but quit due to lack of interest I had in the field.</p>
          <p>When I married my wife here, from my limited English, I tried to find a job that didn't require a specialty degree and something I could study and take an exam right away.</p>
          <p>As a result, I ended up in this field for a while now and am currently working as well!</p>
        </section>
        <section id="demographic">
          <h3>What's your main demographic for your job?</h3>
          <p>For my job, I primarily work with Koreans due to my proficiency in the language and my connections with the church.</p>
          <p>However, that's not the only community I work with! I work with latinos, chinese, and other Americans that wish to find good insurance plans!</p>
        </section>
        <section id="misconceptions">
          <h3>What is the most common misconception you faced while working in health insurance?</h3>
          <p>The biggest misconception that I have encountered was regarding that of pre-existing conditions.</p>
          <p>Pre-existing conditions is when you have health problems prior to having a health insurance.</p>
          <p>Many people believe that from having pre-existing conditions causes their insurance rates to go up.</p>
          <p>However with the passing of the affordable care act (ACA), people can contest their charges online as it's legal to allow this to occur.</p>
          <p>If you have any similar problems with your plan, do not hesitate to contact me through my <a href="contacts.html">contacts</a> list.</p>
