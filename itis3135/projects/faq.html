    <h2>FAQ</h2>
    <div class="faq">
      <div id="q1" class="question" onclick="toggleAnswer('a1')">Where are you from?</div>
      <div id="a1" class="answer">
        <p>I am from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daegu">Daegu, South Korea</a>. I moved to the US around 1991 to live with my sister and brother.</p>
      </div>

      <div id="q2" class="question" onclick="toggleAnswer('a2')">What made you want to become an insurance agent?</div>
      <div id="a2" class="answer">
        <p>Before coming to the US, I worked as an architect but lost interest in the field.</p>
        <p>After getting married here, I sought a job that didn’t require a specialized degree but allowed certification through exams, leading me to insurance.</p>
      </div>

      <div id="q3" class="question" onclick="toggleAnswer('a3')">What's your main demographic for your job?</div>
      <div id="a3" class="answer">
        <p>I primarily work with Korean clients due to language and church community ties, but also serve Latino, Chinese, and other American clients seeking quality insurance.</p>
      </div>

      <div id="q4" class="question" onclick="toggleAnswer('a4')">What is the most common misconception you faced while working in health insurance?</div>
      <div id="a4" class="answer">
        <p>A major misconception involves pre-existing conditions. Many believe these conditions increase rates.</p>
        <p>However, the Affordable Care Act prevents discrimination for pre-existing conditions, and unjust charges can be contested.</p>
