          <h3><strong>Personal Background:</strong></h3>
          <p>
          Hello, I’m from Raleigh! I came down to Charlotte to major in Computer Science for my Bachelor’s degree! 
          I was interested in this field due to taking some basic coding classes in Wake Tech and 
          ultimately settled here to further my education and possibly go into graduate school for 
          a Master’s or a Phd in Large Language Models (LLM) or other AI related topics. I’m still considering the 4+1 program here.
          </p>
          <br><br>

          <h3><strong>Professional Background:</strong></h3>
          <p>
            I worked in a variety of odd professions as a private tutor, restaurant cashier, and a health insurance agent assistant.
          </p>
          <br><br>

          <h3><strong>Academic Background:</strong></h3>
          <p>
          Associates in Data Science & Programming Support Services: Took this associate's track because 
          I thought it would be interesting to get into Data Science as a career. I later understood I might be better 
          off getting more familiar with Computer Science as a major rather than Data Science for undergrad because 
          of creating a better fundamental understanding of coding. I’m planning on pursuing a Data Science master’s program 
          or possibly switching to a Computer Science master’s with an AI concentration in the future.<br> 
          Associates of Science: Took this associate’s track because it was required in order to pursue a degree in a four year college, 
          later ended up having to take the associates in Data Science because I wanted to familiarize myself with Computer Science in general.
          </p>
          <br><br>

          <h3><strong>Background in the Subject:</strong></h3>
          <p>
            Took previous web development classes in Wake Tech. Worked on a capstone project in Wake Tech with both front-end and 
            back-end experience though it’s more with basic Python, Javascript, CSS, and HTML. Took the software development class 
            (ITSC-3155) in UNCC so I have some familiarity with the Django framework. 
          </p>
          <br>

            <h3><strong>Primary Computer Platform:</strong></h3>
          <p>  
            MacOS and Windows
          </p>
          <br>

            <h3><strong>Courses that I am taking &amp; why:</strong></h3>
          
            <p><i><strong>ITCS 3112- Design & Implementation of Object-Oriented Programming and System Development:</strong></i><br>
            I wanted to familiarize myself more with object-oriented programming as using object-oriented programming 
            is especially helpful in the software engineering (SWE) field for developing web applications. <br>
          </p>
          <br>

          <p><i><strong>ITIS 3135- Web-Based Application Design and Development:</strong></i><br>
            I wanted to get more familiar with creating web based applications that would help with creating more personal 
            web pages for personal projects. <br>
          </p>
          <br>
          
          <p><i><strong>ITSC 3310- Software Architecture and Design:</strong></i><br>
            I wanted to learn how to start high level designs for projects as I felt that is probably where most projects are 
            likely to fail as having a solid blueprint is important before starting a project. I wanted to also become familiar 
            with software architecture and design patterns.
          </p>
          <br>
          
          <p><i><strong>STAT 2122- Intro to Probability and Statistics:</strong></i><br>
            Though this class is required, I thought it was especially important considering the big picture concepts of 
            creating normalized curves with data sets and some basic fundamentals of probability to explain occurrences with errors 
            in AI models and data science topics.
          </p>
          <br>
          
          <p><i><strong>ITSC 2181- Intro to Computer Systems:</strong></i><br>
            This class helps with understanding how data is being flowed in a network while understanding 
            the importance of the architecture of computers and their components with the introduction of 
            low level languages with assembly and C (It’s another mandatory class though).
          </p>
          <br>

          <h3><strong>Fun Facts About Me:</strong></h3>
          <p>
            I have a lot of cute stickers on my Macbook, going to add more when I can. 
            I’m willing to take any suggestions of the next sticker to add!<br>
          </p>
