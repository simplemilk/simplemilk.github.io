            <p>Thankfully, to invest in the hobby it is free!</p>
            <p>The only issue is that if you want to buy albums can be hard as some of the artists are not that popular.</p>
            <p>The other issue is that when people generally think of KRnB they tend to think about KPop which is completely different.</p>
            <p>Due to this issue it can be fairly difficult to find them however there are alternatives...</p>
            <p>I recommend if you are looking for physical copies to buy them on Amazon or buy them through independent vendors.</p>
            <p>Though due to the nature of some of the artists not being too popular, you can find their songs relatvely easy in Youtube.</p>
