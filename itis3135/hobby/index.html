            <p>This site is a general hobby page looking into my personal interests in Korean Rhythmn and Blues (K-RnB).</p>
            <p>When listening to artists in this genre, there are a couple of <strong>factors</strong> to consider when looking for an artist:</p>

            <ol id="types">
                <li>Rhythm</li>
                <li>Instruments</li>
                <li>Mood</li>
                <li>Melody</li>
                <li>Lyrics</li>
            </ol>

            <p>Here are some artist recommendations I would listen to:</p>
            
            <h4>Dean (Vocal powerhouse)</h4>
            <p>One of the most influential K-RnB artists, with amazing vocal techniques and amazing runs, he was the one that definitely got me interested in the genre hands down.</p>
            <p>With classics such as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKyMIrBClYw" target="_blank">Instagram</a> that showcased his vocal skills and lyrical composition.</p>
            <p>As well his smooth break up song with the usage of drums and piano in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMrYfJGm7kM" target="_blank">What2Do (ft.Crush & Jeff Bernet)</a>.</p>

            <h4>Hoody (Like a Warm Sunny Day)</h4>
            <p>A chill laid-back artist that well-known in the music space that incorporates unique melodic sounds to create a relaxing memorable experience such as the usage of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DXV_t5MlFA" target="_blank">HANGANG(Han River)</a>.</p> 
            <p>While incorporationg bouncy melodic beats with warm tones like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71u22kLUtic" target="_blank">D-Day(ft. GIRIBOY)</a>.</p>

            <h4>DPR LIVE (Experimental and Unique) </h4>
            <p>One of the most influential artists in the electronic music scene with the incorporation of psychadellic sounds and melodic rap with songs such as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Brvws-nPc" target="_blank">Geronimo!</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jg9NbDizoPM" target="_blank">Jasmine</a>.</p>

            <h3>The difficulty of booking a concert</h3>
            <p>Generally for other genres of music, specifically KPop, it is pretty easy to find concert dates due to its immense popularity.</p>
            <p>Thus, it can be hard to find a concret date especially for specific artists (Looking at you DEAN) making it hard to know when they are avaiable.</p>
            <p>The other issue is that most of the concerts are generally in Korea so there is likely less artists willing to go out to have a concert in the US.</p>
            <p>When it comes to mainstream artists, it should be easier to find them using TicketMaster, KPlay, and SeatGeeks.</p>

            <h3>From the West to the East</h3>
            <p>In the start of the '40s, Korean music was mostly dominated from genres heavily inspired from their neighbors.
            <p>Thus, music genres such as trot, the Korean version of the Japanese enka, and pansori, Korean storytelling opera which was inspired from Chinese opera, was dominating the music scene.</p>
            <p>However, after the rise of popularity of R&B and Pop, it slowly started to get introduced into the US as well as Koreans producing their own interpretations of the genres in the form of KRnB and KPop.</p>
            <p>From the first exposure of the native version of these songs through Seo Taeji and The Boys in the '90s, KRnB and KPop have become an interest in Korea</p>

            <h3>The Rise of Boy and Girl Bands</h3>
            <p>After the success of Seo Taeji and the Boys, several artists started to emerge pursuing these music ventures.</p> 
            <p>Artists like Jin Young Park (JYP) and Yang Shin Hyuk (YG), an ex-member of Seo Taeji, started to form their own entertainment companies after the initial boom of the genre.</p>
            <p>At this time period, a lot of boy groups and girl groups started to emerge where groups such as HOT, G.O.D, Sechskies, and S.E.S dominated the market.</p>
            <p>Thus overtime they started to develop their own sounds where it incorporated a mixture of several genres such as Pop, Ballads, and RnB.</p>

            <h3>The Emergence of the Underground</h3>
            <p>After the success of these entertainment groups, several artists have started to emerge that didn't want to join the bigger entertainment companies.</p>
            <p>Due to their intense training and their strict regimes, trainees who were not able to make it into these companies ended up starting their own ventures.</p>
            <p>Thus, several other artist such as Tiger JK, Insooni, and YoonmiRae has emerged as well where a new age and genre of music emerged.</p> 
            <p>KHipHop, KRap and KR&B has started to develop further from these underground artists.</p>

            <h3>Modern Day</h3>
            <p>Nowadays there are a lot more artists that have been released and popularized in the underground that later became mainstream artists.</p>
            <p>Such examples include Crush, DEAN, Hoody, and BIBI.</p>
            <p>The genre now is striving as they release more and more artists, it can get overwhelming trying to figure out which artist is worth listening to.</p>
            <p>Thus there is a <a href="./index.html">page</a> to help introduce visitors on some artists to listen to.</p>

                <p>KRnB is versatile, although it seems like one genre there is a lot of different kinds of artists in this umbrella.</p>
                <p>Nowadays, there's a lot of different types of artists due to the amount of newer uprising artists constantly popping up in the scene.</p>
                <p>As mentioned prior, there are people like DEAN that sing mainstream RnB music, DPR Live that plays EDM music, and Hoody that sings chill RnB.</p>

            <p>Thankfully, to listen to songs it is free!</p>
            <p>The only issue is that if you want to buy albums can be hard as some of the artists are not that popular.</p>
            <p>The other issue is that when people generally think of KRnB they tend to think about KPop which is completely different.</p>
            <p>Generally with a lot of smaller artists, due to their albums not selling in big bulks.</p>
            <p>They sell the albums in pre-order so it can be hard to get a hold of physical copies at times.</p>
            <p>Thus, due to this issue it can be fairly difficult to find them however there are alternatives...</p>
            <p>I recommend if you are looking for physical copies to buy them on Amazon or buy them through independent vendors.</p>
            <p>Though due to the nature of some of the artists not being too popular, you can find their songs relatvely easy in Youtube.</p>
        <hr>
            <h3>Recommended shops and listening experiences</h3>
            <p>Though the difficulty of finding of physical copies can be hard, digital ones can be generally easier.</p>
            <p>When it comes to supporting artists, buying their songs in Apple Music can be helpful or sometimes you can find the physical albums in Amazon.</p>
            <p>There are also alternatives to find the music in Youtube as well.</p>
