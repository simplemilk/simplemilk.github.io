            <h3><a href="https://userinyerface.com" target="_blank">User Inyerface</a></h3>
            <p>This website is an example of a bad website where it doesn't follow the criteria of being 
                clean, intuitive, and accessible web design.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Contrast: The site can be hard to read with the background and that of the paragraph color. The usage of dark green can blend easily with the blue in the background.</li>
                <li>Repetition: The fonts are inconsistent as when you look at the description regarding the no button it changes as well as there are unclear instructions in the page.</li>
                <li>Alignment: Everything is centered in the middle. Which can be problematic as doing so would increase the amount of space available in the webpage making it all cluttered in one area instead of it looking well placed.</li>
                <li>Proximity: As mentioned prior the webpage is cluttered in the middle where there are not a lot of space inbetween the button and that of the other sentences thus making it just look like a cluttered spot than a well spaced one.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h3><a href="https://apple.com" target="_blank">Apple</h3>
            <p>One of the most innovative companies when it comes to the usage of UI/UX in webpages. There's much to be said but one can state how much they perfected the usage of spacing and repetition.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Contrast: The site uses good contrast that makes the text legible and pop out from the background whether it be dark or light.</li>
                <li>Repetition: When looking at how they format their buttons and their menu, it is consistent throughout the page while also using a lot of variety in terms of webpage placements like squares and imagery.</li>
                <li>Alignment: All the pages in the site have variety. In the imagery of the apple watch it's centered whereas when it comes to other topics that are not their main focus they would put it in blocks making the user able to understand what is written
                    while also not taking away from the focus of the main products Apple wants to sell.</li>
                <li>Proximity: There is a lot of space between the objects found in the site. It's easy to differentiate between one object to another making it simple and easy to look through without causing much difficulty.</li>
            </ul>
